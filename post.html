                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>When talking about papers being biased, there’s often an immediate confusion. Students start to look at the funding sources for authors, googling who the authors are and what organizations they are affiliated with. It’s true, that is a source of bias, but not the kind that I write about. </p>
                        <div id="boxshadow">
                            <h1>Miriam Webster definition</h1>
                            <p>Its nice to meet you!</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>My students confuse the much more common usage of the word “bias” as a personal judgment with statistical bias, which is much more related to definition 1c from Merriam-Webster. That is, a tendency. </p>
                        <p>In statistics, when we talk about an estimator being biased, we mean that we do not expect our process of coming to an estimate to be the true value on average. There’s a tendency for it to be different than the true value- higher or lower. Let’s unpack that.</p>
                        <p>Here’s a concrete example: Let’s say that you wanted to know which candidate was likely to win an election. You go to a college campus and ask people who they are going to vote for.  You are likely going to hear much more left-leaning opinions than if we were to take a random sample of the general population, and so the percentage of people who support the left leaning candidate will be much higher on the college campus than in the general population. </p>
                        <p>Is that because of your political beliefs? No, surely not everyone reading this blog post has the same political opinions. It’s because of the process of finding this estimate that leads it to generally finding a higher percentage of left-leaning voters than the true proportion in the general population. </p>
                        <p>Why does our estimate have a tendency to be different from the true proportion? Because of bias. (In our concrete example, we have “selection bias.”)</p>
                        <p>In statistics, we assume that there is one “true value.” In our example, it would be the true percentage of all voters who support a candidate. When we take a sample or do an observational study, we can estimate this true value. When our process of finding the estimate makes it so that our estimate is often off, we call this bias. </p>
                        <p>Putting on our tin foil hat, we can be skeptical that personal bias might lead a researcher to intentionally create a study that has a statistical bias that would support their opinion. I’ll leave those speculations for scandalous headlines, and focus on understanding the causal implications of the work they have done. </p>
                        <p>When we read papers, we want to keep an eye out for bias in order to better understand the story happening in the paper. If we read a paper that finds results that line up with the bias, then we know to not be surprised. But if the bias leads us to believe that the opposite of what is reported would happen, then we can look much more deeply at what might be going on. </p>
